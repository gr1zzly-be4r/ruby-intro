		This also has a bit of user input, but less than the food calories calculating program. The goal of this lab is to make a program that simulates many games of rock, paper, scissors between a rotating player and 
		a random player. The only user input that needs to be made is how many games of rock, paper, scissors you
		want the program to run.
		<br />
		The rest of the program should just use Ruby's <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Random.html">Random</a> object to generate a random value for the "random" player and play that value against a "rotating" player. The rotating player should just cycle through the values of rock, paper, and scissors. After playing the number of rounds, the program should print out the winning percentages of each player. Don't forget to count the ties!
