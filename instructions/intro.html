		The files in this repo are meant to serve as an introduction to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby.</a> Specifically, to help me get familiarized with the language in an attempt to learn <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails.</a>
		<br />
		I had wanted to learn Rails for a while, and finally took the time to try and learn it over Christmas.
		I soon found that it would be easy to learn the framework without knowing how to code in Ruby. That's
		where the idea for this repo came from. As the README.md states, the files are going to be roughly 
		based off an intro comp sci course that was taught in Java.
		<br />
		More to come.
