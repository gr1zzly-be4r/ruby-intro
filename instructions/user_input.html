		The original course did most of the "user input" from little dialog boxes that sprung up from Eclipse. 
		I did not know how to do something similar in Ruby, so the user input in this repository is all 
		command-line based.
		<br />
		Basic premise of this lab is to make a program that calculates the amount of calories that a food contains from user supplied input. Think "x food has 25 grams of fat, how many calories would this be?"
		Some general rules:
		***Disclaimer: I have no idea whether these calculations are nutritionally accurate***
		<ul>
			<li>A gram of <em>carbohydrates</em> is 4 calories.</li>
			<li>A gram of <em>fat</em> is 9 calories.</li>
			<li>A gram of <em>protein</em> is 4 calories.</li>
		</ul>
		The program needs to do 3 things:
		<ol>
			<li>Ask the user for a food.</li>
			<li>Get information about that food.</li>
			<li>Process the information about that food and give that information back to the user.</li>
		</ol>
		An example output could be:
		<br />
		<br />
		Snickers has x amount of calories:
			x amount of grams of fat
			x amount of grams of carbohydrates
			x amount of grams of protein

		This means that you have x total calories.

		Should you eat this food? [yes/no determined by coin flip]
